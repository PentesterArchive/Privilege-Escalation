# SUID3NUM
## SUID automatic enumeration.
- List all Default SUID Binaries (which ship with linux/aren't exploitable)
- List all Custom Binaries (which don't ship with packages/vanilla installation)
- List all custom binaries found in GTFO Bin's (This is where things get interesting)
- Printing binaries and their exploitation (in case they create files on the machine)
- Try and exploit found custom SUID binaries which won't impact machine's files
